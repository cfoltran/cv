**[Open climate collabathon](https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth/) in HEC Paris:**<br>
2 days that led us to the creation of a [platform](https://github.com/owalid/Collabathon_2019) interpreting climate data.

**HEC design thinking:**<br>
1 month of reflection around the issue of sustainable development. We created a platform to recycle textile wastes. Our solution allows to connect directly companies ERP in order to access to the unsold goods. This are made available to designers or recycling factories.
