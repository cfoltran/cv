            Expert in cryptocurrencies, Yuzu is a mobile application (IOS and
            Android) for buying and exchanging. Yuzu stands differentiated by
            its simplicity, the purchase of very young crypto advice and p2p,
            enabling cryptos or euros to be sent by SMS (like Lydia). During
            this mission, I completely redesigned the application, participated
            in the development of new features such as recurring purchases, the
            purchase of small cryptos, scoring and improved fluidity. I also
            participated in the application's backend and devops development.
            Since I've been working on the app, the average rating on the store
            has gone from 4.3 to 4.6 in less than two months.

          42 is one of the most difficult programming school. The entrance exam
          takes place over a month. Every day, exercises on C language and a
          group project on weekends. Only one function to write an ascii
          character is allowed:
          <code>write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);</code>
          If you need another function you have to recode it (except malloc).
          Beside some projects.
